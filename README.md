### Likn to website

Open [Harry Potter](https://llavrov.github.io/HarryPotter/) to view it in the browser.



### `technical task`

Create a SPA with a list of cards, each of which displays a picture and any information that came from the API.
The received data is stored in the store.

There should be a like icon on the card. When you click on which, a like is placed or removed. The icon should be tinted when clicked.

There should be a delete icon on the card. When you click on which, the card is deleted.

At the top there should be a filter button, which, when pressed, shows only the liked cards. When released, all cards are shown again.

The design is not important, the main thing is that it is simple and neat.
